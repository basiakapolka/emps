description: |
  This textbook begins with an introduction to theory and concept building, moves to an explanation of causal inference (how do we 'know' whether something is causal?), and then provides a quick introduction to data and hypothesis testing. Following that, each chapter is devoted to a particular research method used within political science: surveys, experiments, large N, small n, game theory, social network analysis, and machine learning. Each chapter follows a similar format and layout to help introduce the method, its advantages, disadvantages, and different applications.
