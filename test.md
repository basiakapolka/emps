::: { .question text="What is the difference between inductive and deductive research?"}

Inductive research generally begins with the gathering of evidence and then generates theory after analyzing the evidence. Deductive research follows the opposite order: it begins with a theory and hypothesis, then on to collecting evidence and testing the hypothesis in light of the data collected.
